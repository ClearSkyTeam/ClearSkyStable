Production builds are completly stable builds, which were tested over an long period of time by one member of the ClearSkyTeam

Stable builds are builds, that are tested and known to work, but they don't have an long period test.


Development Builds are in most cases the latest build. They mostly have experimental fixes and or improvements. 


These builds are only ensured to start and throw with no errors, although there are some TestStates that include:

Safe: ServerStart,Joining, no errors/crashes on Start&Join
Working: ServerStart, no errors/crashes on Start
Starting: ServerStart
