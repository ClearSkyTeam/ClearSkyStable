Stable builds are builds that are tested and known to work, but aren't tested for a long period of time.
 
Development Builds are, in most cases, the latest build. They mostly have experimental fixes and/or improvements. 
These builds are only ensured to start and throw with no errors, although there are some TestStates that include:
 
Safe: ServerStart, Joining, no errors/crashes on Start & Join

Working: ServerStart, no errors/crashes on Start

Starting: ServerStart
